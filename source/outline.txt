For each weight i:
	Initialize a possibleWeightVector to 
	w(j) = 1.0 if j = i, 0 otherwise
	If < 40, then initialize random weight vectors for the rest
	
	
	Loop: 
	Run X simulations against our best bot (until we beat it 80% of the time, then start playing each other)
		Score = how many moves we win/lose by
		Total score
	
	Take top 20 
	Create 20 new weight vectors:
	
	Repeat
